== Emb Nav ==

Grid navigation system for turn based RPGs.

=== v0.1.0 ===

- [ ] GridManager Actor
    - [ ] Futomatic grid generation
    - [ ] Not full regeneration but area based generation.
- [ ] Walkable Engine Trace setting
- [ ] Blueprint exposure for all functionality
- [ ] Long Async navigation task.
- [ ] GridActor Component.
- [ ] Movement and placement utilities (multigird, 2x2 3x3 monster movement)
- [ ] Halfgrid? hmm... this could be a distinct possibility.
    - [ ] Each character would have a size. and their position on the map is representedby just a position.
    - [ ] All bounds checking would be done relative to their size.
    - [ ] What would be the most efficient ways of doing this?
- [ ] Overhangs, towers, ladders, grid links

Ok lets sketch out a few things. 

== rev 1 ==

flow of data:
    - [ ] Editor places walkable grid planes into the world.
    - [ ] Each grid automatically tests if each grid can be visible from place to place.
    - [ ] A linking phase searches through grid planes at runtime to determine which grid planes automatically link against which other grid planes
